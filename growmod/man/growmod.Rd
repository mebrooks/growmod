\title{A function for fitting an autoregressive model including fixed effect covariates and random effects.}
\usage{
growmod(formulaX = ~1, formulaM = ~1, data, estobserr = FALSE,
  sigma_obs = 0.03554119, predfirstsize = NULL, DLL = "growmod",
  silent = TRUE, selecting = FALSE, REtime = TRUE, REID = TRUE,
  REcohort = TRUE, REageID = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formulaX}{a formula for the covariates that affect the intercept of the AR(1) model}

\item{formulaM}{a formula for the covariates that affect the autoregressive coefficient of the AR(1) model}

\item{data}{a data frame of observed sizes and covariates in long format. See details.}

\item{estobserr}{logical - should observation error}

\item{sigma_obs}{the standard deviation of the observation error with the same units as size (e.g. log kg). To be used in a \code{growmod} model when \code{estobserr=FALSE}.}

\item{predfirstsize}{NULL if there are no predictors on first size, or a design matrix of predictors with one row per individau in the order as the individuals first apear in data}

\item{DLL}{the name of the compiled TMB/c++ file}

\item{silent}{logical - Disable all tracing information?}

\item{selecting}{logical - when true, save time by not estimating confidence intervals. Only return AIC and convergence.}

\item{REtime}{logical - estimate a random intercept for each time point}

\item{REID}{logical - estimate a random intercept for each individual}

\item{REcohort}{logical - estimate a random intercept for each cohort with the same \code{t0} (i.e. birth cohort)}

\item{REageID}{logical - estimate a random slope on age for each individual (only use in models that include age in formulaX)}
}
\value{
a list of objects in the correct format to be read in by the TMB model defined in \code{growmod.cpp} with the exception of \code{beta}, \code{eta}, \code{M}, and \code{X} which depend on the model formulas and are defined in the growmod function.

\description{
A function for fitting an autoregressive model including fixed effect covariates and random effects.
}
\details{
data must at least the following columns:\code{size, t, t0}, and \code{ID}. \code{size} is the size of an individual on the log scale. \code{t} is the point in time when an observation was made. \code{t} must be in discrete units (i.e. integers) with increments of 1. \code{t0} is the time when an individual was born. \code{ID} is a unique identifier for each individaul. It must contain at least one row per combination of individual and time. Multiple rows may be needed if an individual was measured more than once at the same timepoint. These multiple measurements inform the estimation of observation error. If multiple rows for the same combination of individual and time are given, then only the predictors from the first instance is used. If a size observation was missed for one combination of individual and time, then that row should have an \code{NA} in the size column, but must contian any covariates. There must be at least one non-missing size for each individual.
